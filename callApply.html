    <h1>Call apply method</h1>
    <p> <span style="color: red;"> what is the difference between call () and apply () in JavaScript?</span> 
        
        Difference between call() and apply() method: The only difference is call() method takes the arguments separated by comma while apply() method takes the array of arguments</p>
    <p>call and apply are very similar—they invoke a function with a specified this context, and optional arguments. The only difference between call and apply is that call requires the arguments to be passed in one-by-one, and apply takes the arguments as an array.</p>
    <p>The apply() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array.
        The apply() method is similar to the call() method excepts that it accepts the arguments of the function as an array instead of individual arguments.</p>
