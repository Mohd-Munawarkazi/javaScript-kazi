    <h1>Bind method</h1>
    <p>  <span style="color: red;"> What is Bind method in JavaScript?</span><br>
        The bind() method allows an object to borrow a method from another object without making a copy of that method. This is known as function borrowing in JavaScript.</p>
        <p> <span style="color: red;"> Why do we use the bind method?</span>   
            We use the Bind() method to call a function with the this value, 
            this keyword refers to the same object which is currently selected . 
            In other words, bind() method allows us to easily set which object will be bound by 
            the this keyword when a function or method is invoked.</p>
